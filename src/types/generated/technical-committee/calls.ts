     *   - `M` is members-count (code- and governance-bounded)
     *   - `P1` is the complexity of `proposal` preimage.
     *   - `P2` is proposal-count (code-bounded)
     * - DB:
     *  - 2 storage reads (`Members`: codec `O(M)`, `Prime`: codec `O(1)`)
     *  - 3 mutations (`Voting`: codec `O(M)`, `ProposalOf`: codec `O(B)`, `Proposals`: codec
     *    `O(P2)`)
     *  - any mutations done while executing `proposal` (`P1`)
     * - up to 3 events
