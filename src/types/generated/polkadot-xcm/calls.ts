     * Transfer assets from the local chain to the destination chain using explicit transfer
     * types for assets and fees.
     * 
     * `assets` must have same reserve location or may be teleportable to `dest`. Caller must
     * provide the `assets_transfer_type` to be used for `assets`:
     *  - `TransferType::LocalReserve`: transfer assets to sovereign account of destination
     *    chain and forward a notification XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based
     *    assets to `beneficiary`.
     *  - `TransferType::DestinationReserve`: burn local assets and forward a notification to
     *    `dest` chain to withdraw the reserve assets from this chain's sovereign account and
     *    deposit them to `beneficiary`.
     *  - `TransferType::RemoteReserve(reserve)`: burn local assets, forward XCM to `reserve`
     *    chain to move reserves from this chain's SA to `dest` chain's SA, and forward another
     *    XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based assets to `beneficiary`. Typically
     *    the remote `reserve` is Asset Hub.
     *  - `TransferType::Teleport`: burn local assets and forward XCM to `dest` chain to
     *    mint/teleport assets and deposit them to `beneficiary`.
     * 
     * On the destination chain, as well as any intermediary hops, `BuyExecution` is used to
     * buy execution using transferred `assets` identified by `remote_fees_id`.
     * Make sure enough of the specified `remote_fees_id` asset is included in the given list
     * of `assets`. `remote_fees_id` should be enough to pay for `weight_limit`. If more weight
     * is needed than `weight_limit`, then the operation will fail and the sent assets may be
     * at risk.
     * 
     * `remote_fees_id` may use different transfer type than rest of `assets` and can be
     * specified through `fees_transfer_type`.
     * 
     * The caller needs to specify what should happen to the transferred assets once they reach
     * the `dest` chain. This is done through the `custom_xcm_on_dest` parameter, which
     * contains the instructions to execute on `dest` as a final step.
     *   This is usually as simple as:
     *   `Xcm(vec![DepositAsset { assets: Wild(AllCounted(assets.len())), beneficiary }])`,
     *   but could be something more exotic like sending the `assets` even further.
     * 
     * - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM.
     * - `dest`: Destination context for the assets. Will typically be `[Parent,
     *   Parachain(..)]` to send from parachain to parachain, or `[Parachain(..)]` to send from
     *   relay to parachain, or `(parents: 2, (GlobalConsensus(..), ..))` to send from
     *   parachain across a bridge to another ecosystem destination.
     * - `assets`: The assets to be withdrawn. This should include the assets used to pay the
     *   fee on the `dest` (and possibly reserve) chains.
     * - `assets_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `assets`.
     * - `remote_fees_id`: One of the included `assets` to be used to pay fees.
     * - `fees_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `fees` assets.
     * - `custom_xcm_on_dest`: The XCM to be executed on `dest` chain as the last step of the
     *   transfer, which also determines what happens to the assets on the destination chain.
     * - `weight_limit`: The remote-side weight limit, if any, for the XCM fee purchase.
