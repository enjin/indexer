     *  A fee mulitplier for `Operational` extrinsics to compute "virtual tip" to boost their
     *  `priority`
     * 
     *  This value is multipled by the `final_fee` to obtain a "virtual tip" that is later
     *  added to a tip component in regular `priority` calculations.
     *  It means that a `Normal` transaction can front-run a similarly-sized `Operational`
     *  extrinsic (with no tip), by including a tip value greater than the virtual tip.
     * 
     *  ```rust,ignore
     *  // For `Normal`
     *  let priority = priority_calc(tip);
     * 
     *  // For `Operational`
     *  let virtual_tip = (inclusion_fee + tip) * OperationalFeeMultiplier;
     *  let priority = priority_calc(tip + virtual_tip);
     *  ```
     * 
     *  Note that since we use `final_fee` the multiplier applies also to the regular `tip`
     *  sent with the transaction. So, not only does the transaction get a priority bump based
     *  on the `inclusion_fee`, but we also amplify the impact of tips applied to `Operational`
     *  transactions.
